# Buy-Rent-Sell-IITG
“Buy-Rent-Sell”- as the name is self-explanatory, this app is developed with an intent to provide a dedicated online platform to the residents of IIT-Guwahati so that they can 
sell or rent out their spare items, buy them or rent in case they need it for little time. 
This will eliminate the pain of surfing through the current Facebook group to find if there is something that satisfies one’s requirement.
With features like subscription to the product category of one’s interest, one can always find the products that are available in their feed. You can call or drop a text to 
the seller via the app, if the deal fascinates you, so that no one can grab your deal before you. One question that might be ticking your heads is that would it take much 
effort to sell or rent something ,then don’t worry since we have taken the full care of your time, all you need to just fill in the relevant details, upload one relevant pic 
and you are done and so, its time for your potential buyers to give you a ring.
The main features of this App are-
1. Google/Manual Authentication
2. Personalised feed
3. In-App Chat Feature
4. Temporarily hiding of Product(for Rent Items)
5. A specialised section for “Give Away”
